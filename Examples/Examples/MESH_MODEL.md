WEB3MSGBOARD — Mesh Model (Plain-English Diagram)

WEB3MSGBOARD — a Distributed Status Mesh

WEB3MSGBOARD is a distributed check-in system where each person controls their own writable status page and others know where to find it when systems fail.

The Old Model (Hub)

Most systems work like this:

One person or admin posts
Everyone else waits

Diagram:

Person A
⬇
Group Board
⬆
Person B
⬆
Person C

If the board fails, everyone fails.

The WEB3MSGBOARD Model (Mesh)

Each person controls their own node.

Diagram:

Person A → A’s status page
Person B → B’s status page
Person C → C’s status page

Everyone stores everyone else’s address.

When something happens:

No one waits

No one asks permission

No one depends on a single board

They check.

Why This Matters

In real emergencies:

People act independently

Systems fail unevenly

Authorities may be unreachable

Platforms may go down

A mesh survives partial failure.

Example

Instead of:

familymsg.web3

You use:

dadstatus.web3
momstatus.web3
kid1status.web3
grandma.web3

Everyone stores these in advance.

When systems strain:
You check.
You don’t wait.

What This Is Not

This is not:

A chat

A group feed

A social space

A command center

It is a status signaling mesh.

Core Principle

Each person writes their own status.
Others know where to check.
No central authority is required.
