WEB3MSGBOARD — UD Bio Templates

WEB3MSGBOARD — a Distributed Status Mesh

WEB3MSGBOARD is a distributed check-in system where each person controls their own writable status page and others know where to find it when systems fail.

These templates are designed for use in the Bio section of a Web3 domain.

They are not profiles.
They are status nodes.
