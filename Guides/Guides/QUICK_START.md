WEB3MSGBOARD — Quick Start

WEB3MSGBOARD — a Distributed Status Mesh

WEB3MSGBOARD is a distributed check-in system where each person controls their own writable status page and others know where to find it when systems fail.

This guide explains how a family, team, or group can adopt WEB3MSGBOARD in under 30 minutes.

Step 1 — Each Person Gets One Domain

This is a personal node system.

Each person must control their own writable page.

Examples:

dadstatus.web3

momstatus.web3

kid1status.web3

grandmastatus.web3

Do not share logins.
Do not centralize updates.

Step 2 — Decide What Your Updates Look Like

Agree in advance on a simple format.

Example:

Status: OK
Location: Heading home
Last update: 6:40 PM

Keep it:

Short

Factual

Calm

Non-conversational

Step 3 — Store Everyone’s Domain in Your Contacts

Every participant should store everyone else’s domain:

In phone contacts

In a notes app

On paper

On a laminated card

In a wallet note

Example contact note:

Fallback status page: momstatus.web3

This is critical.
Do this before anything happens.

Step 4 — Decide When to Update

Only update when:

Your safety changes

Your location changes

Your availability changes

Do NOT:

Chat

Explain

Reassure emotionally

Comment on others

This is a signal system, not a conversation.

Step 5 — Agree on Fallback Behavior

If systems strain:

Do not message first

Check the person’s page

Only message if absolutely needed

Keep updates minimal

Step 6 — Offline Backup (Strongly Recommended)

Each person should keep:

A written list of everyone’s domains

A screenshot of this list

A printed or laminated card

Assume:

No power

No cloud

No sync

Core Principle

Each person writes their own status.
Others know where to check.
No central authority is required.
