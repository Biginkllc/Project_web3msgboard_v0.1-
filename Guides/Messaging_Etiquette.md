WEB3MSGBOARD — Messaging Etiquette

WEB3MSGBOARD — a Distributed Status Mesh

WEB3MSGBOARD is a distributed check-in system where each person controls their own writable status page and others know where to find it when systems fail.

This document defines behavioral rules, not manners.

This is not social media.
This is not chat.
This is not a feed.

This is a signal system.

Core Rule

Your page is for your status only.

Do not:

Comment on others

Respond to others

Explain others

Interpret others

Debate others

Each node is independent.

What to Post

Posts should be:

Short

Factual

Calm

Objective

Time-stamped

Examples:

Status: OK
Location: Heading home
Last update: 6:40 PM

Status: Safe
Power: Out
Next update: 9:00 PM

Status: Relocating
Meet point: Community library

What NOT to Post

Do not post:

Emotional processing

Commentary

Political opinions

Explanations

Stories

Blame

Fear language

Predictions

Arguments

Questions

This is not a conversation surface.

Update Frequency

Post only when:

Your status changes

Your location changes

Your availability changes

Your safety changes

Do NOT post:

Hourly updates “just in case”

Commentary updates

Emotional reassurance updates

Signal only when signal is needed.

Ownership Rules

Only the owner of the domain writes.

Others:

View

Check

Do not reply

Do not correct

Do not interpret

Failure Mode Discipline

Assume:

Bandwidth is limited

Attention is limited

People are stressed

Your job is to reduce cognitive load.

Why This Matters

In emergencies, conversational systems fail.

They:

Overload

Spiral emotionally

Create misinformation

Create conflict

Create confusion

WEB3MSGBOARD is intentionally non-conversational.

Core Principle

Each person writes their own status.
Others know where to check.
No central authority is required.
