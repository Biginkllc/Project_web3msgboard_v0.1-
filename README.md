**WEB3MSGBOARD — a Distributed Status Mesh**

> WEB3MSGBOARD is a distributed check-in system where each person controls their own writable status page and others know where to find it when systems fail.

---

## Core Principle

Each person writes their own status.  
Others know where to check.  
No central authority is required.

---

## What This Is

WEB3MSGBOARD is a human-first fallback communication framework.

Instead of relying on a single group board, admin, or authority, each participant maintains their own simple, writable status page. Others can view it, but only the owner can update it.

This removes:
- Single points of failure
- Posting bottlenecks
- Central dependencies
- Permission-based check-ins

It enables calm, distributed signaling:
> “I’m safe.”  
> “I made it.”  
> “Meet at the usual place.”

## What This Is Not

WEB3MSGBOARD is **not**:

- ❌ A chat app  
- ❌ A social network  
- ❌ A group message board  
- ❌ A real-time feed  
- ❌ A replacement for emergency services  

It is a **fallback layer**, not a primary communication channel.

## Architecture (Plain English)

Most emergency communication systems are built as hubs:

One writer → many readers.

WEB3MSGBOARD is built as a mesh:

Many writers → many readers.

Each person:
- Owns their own writable status node (page)
- Updates it when needed
- Shares the location of that node with others in advance

Others:
- Know where to look
- Do not need permission
- Do not wait for a central update

If one node fails, the rest still work.

## Example Use

Instead of one family board:

> familymsg.web3

Each person has their own:

- dadstatus.web3  
- momstatus.web3  
- kid1status.web3  
- grandma.web3  

These addresses are stored:
- In phone contacts
- On paper
- On laminated cards
- In wallet notes

When systems strain, people check—not wait.

## Origin & Provenance

**WEB3MSGBOARD — Founder Entry · Provenance anchored June 2022 · Open for repomorphing**

The term *WEB3MSGBOARD* and its associated concept originated with early namespace acquisitions including `web3msgboard.crypto` and `web3msgboard.nft` on June 9, 2022.

The namespace was expanded on November 28, 2025 across both Web2 and Web3 layers (.blockchain, .com, .hub, .info, .online, .unstoppable, .web3).

WEB3MSGBOARD defines a distributed status signaling model in which each person maintains their own writable message page that others can view. The framework is released as open-source for repomorphing and public adaptation.

---

## Why This Exists

When systems fail, people don’t need more noise.

They need:
- Known locations
- Simple instructions
- Calm signals
- Redundancy

WEB3MSGBOARD exists to make that simple.

---

## Repomorphing

This project is intentionally open.

You are encouraged to:
- Fork it
- Adapt it
- Translate it
- Extend it
- Localize it

Do not centralize it.

---

## Status

Early framework.  
Concept stabilized.  
Architecture locked.  

Next layers: diagrams, onboarding, offline flows, and optional extensions.
