### *A Community Experiment in Domain-Based Public Messaging*  
**Version:** v0.1  
**Author:** Lloyd W. Jones, Jr.  
**Status:** Concept Draft — Educational & Non-Speculative  

---

## 1. Purpose  
**web3msgboard** is a lightweight, optional, community-driven experiment that explores how Unstoppable Domains’ existing **Bio** section can be used as a simple, public-facing message board between domain holders.

This is **not** a trading tool, not a signal system, and not a speculative strategy.  
It is an **art, communication, and culture experiment** inside the Web3 identity layer.

---

## 2. Why This Works Today  
Unstoppable Domains (UD) provides each domain with a public profile containing:

- Display name  
- Bio text  
- Social links  
- Domain list  

Because the **Bio field** is public, editable, and already part of UD’s interface, it offers a unique opportunity:

> A domain owner can post a message in their bio,  
> and another domain owner can respond by editing theirs.  

No plugin, blockchain update, or new infrastructure required.

---

## 3. Why This Is NOT a Pump-and-Dump  
This project:

- Does **not** ask anyone to buy a domain  
- Does **not** claim or imply future profit  
- Does **not** depend on UD policy, token value, or market conditions  
- Does **not** encourage speculation  
- Does **not** rely on long-term guarantees from any platform  

Instead, it demonstrates a **creative use-case** for a feature that already exists — nothing more.

---

## 4. Long-Term Safety and Future-Proofing  
If UD ever modifies, limits, or removes the Bio field:

- All web3msgboard messages can be **mirrored to IPFS**  
- Discussions can continue via **GitHub Issues / Discussions**  
- Message history can be preserved in the **Backups_IPFS/CID_Log.txt** file  

The project is designed to **adapt** without disruption.

---

## 5. How to Participate (Optional)  
1. Edit your UD **Bio** with a message, thought, or greeting.  
2. Include a simple signature such as:  
   `#web3msgboard`  
3. Check other UD profiles for responses or public notes.  
4. Mirror your message to IPFS if you want permanent proof.

This is purely voluntary and open-ended.

## 6. Recommended Message Etiquette  
- Be respectful  
- No harassment or defamation  
- No personal attacks  
- No financial solicitation  
- No sensitive data  
- Keep messages brief and positive  
- Remember: UD profiles are public

A full etiquette guide appears in `/Guides/Messaging_Etiquette.md`.
